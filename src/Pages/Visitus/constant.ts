  "The Goverdhan gaushala at ISKCON is a haven for cows, providing them with a safe and loving environment where they can thrive and live out their lives in peace. Located on the grounds of the temple, the gaushala is home to a herd of cows who are treated with the utmost care and respect.",

  "We are currently serving more than 110 Deshi Cows wholeheartedly, where they are brought from surrounding areas sometimes in critical need for care, sometimes being abandoned because they cannot be milked further, and sometimes the caretakers leaving then with us because they cannot keep them anymore",

  "Visitors to the gaushala are immediately struck by the serene and peaceful atmosphere, which is filled with the gentle sound of mooing cows and the rustling of leaves in the breeze. The cows roam freely throughout the spacious grounds, grazing on fresh grass and enjoying the sunshine.",

  "The gaushala is not just a sanctuary for cows, however - it is also a place of learning and inspiration for visitors. Guests can take part in guided tours of the facility, where they can learn about the importance of cow protection and the vital role that cows play in Vedic culture.",
