   "Saudasa said, “ O my lord! O sinless sage, what is that pure object within the three worlds that simply by taking its name, human beings can accumulate great piety?”. The great sage Vasistha said, “O king, many varieties of aroma emanate from the body of a cow. The cow is the support of all living entities, and the ocean of auspiciousness.”. “The cow is the past and future. She nourishes the health of all living entities, and she is the root of prosperity. The piety one achieves by feeding a cow is never destroyed.”. “Do not go to bed at night without praising the cows. Do not get up in the morning without remembering the cow. Offer respect to the cow daily,in the morning. By doing so, a human being achieves strength and nourishment.”. “Do not hate cow urine and cow dung. Never eat cow meat. By following this advice, human beings can become prosperous.”. “Chant the name of the cow daily and never insult her. If one sees a bad dream, one should immediately remember the cow.”. A person who, either during the day or at night, either in happiness or at a time of fearful conditions, remembers or glorifies the cow, certainly becomes freed from all fearful conditions. One should see, offer obeisances to, and circumambulate the cow. By doing so, one is supposed to have circumambulated the entire earth, with it’s seven islands. The cow is the mother of all. She gives happiness to everyone. People who desire prosperity should daily circumambulate the cow.",
