  "Flower Festival (Holi), the festival of colors, is another much-awaited festival at ISKCON Vallabh Vidya Nagar. The temple grounds are transformed into a kaleidoscope of colors, as devotees throw colored powders and water at each other in a spirit of love and unity. Joyful kirtan and dance performances take place throughout the day, and the atmosphere is charged with positive energy and enthusiasm.",
