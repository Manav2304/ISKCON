  "ISKCON Vallabh Vidya Nagar celebrates two significant festivals, Kartik and Diwali, with great devotion and enthusiasm. The month of Kartik is dedicated to Lord Krishna and involves special prayers, chanting, and aarti. Diwali signifies the victory of light over darkness and is celebrated with lighting diyas, performing aarti, and a grand feast. Both festivals provide an opportunity for devotees to connect with their spiritual essence, renew their faith and devotion towards Radha and Krishna, and experience their infinite love and grace.",
