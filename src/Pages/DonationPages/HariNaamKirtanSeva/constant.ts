  "In 1978, however, less than a year after the disappearance of His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada, 24 hour kirtana at the Krsna-Balaram Mandir was unfortunately ground to a halt. Re-inauguration commenced eight years later, during the Kartika eve on Vijaya Dasami 1986, by the determined efforts of His Grace Sriman Aindra prabhu, a disciple of Srila Prabhupada, with the assistance and support of a few other soft-hearted devotees. Aindra prabhu, recognizing the common sense in organizing a core group of kirtana enthusiasts to ensure its continuance, reconstituted ISKCON Vrndavanaâ€™s 24 hour kirtana as a distinguished department of service. In the beginning, upon suggestion and sponsorship, hired singers and musicians formed part of the kirtana group.",
