  "Mohini Ekadashi is an auspicious day in the Vaishnav calendar. It falls during the waxing phase of the moon, in the month of Vaishak. This year, it falls on May 1st, and we at ISKCON Vrindavana urge all our devotees and well-wishers to observe this day with fervor and devotion.",

  "As we grapple with the challenges of the present times, it is tempting to seek refuge in worldly pursuits and forget our spiritual roots. However, the teachings of the Vaishnav tradition remind us of the transitory nature of the material world and the importance of connecting with our divine selves. Mohini Ekadashi is a reminder of this connection, as it symbolizes Lord Vishnu's awakening from his slumber.",

  "On this day, devotees fast, offer prayers, and perform rituals to appease Lord Vishnu. They also engage in self-reflection and introspection, meditating on the importance of leading a spiritually fulfilling life. This practice allows us to connect with a higher power and gain a deeper understanding of our place in the world.",
