  "Sri Gaura Purnima is the auspicious appearance day of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also known as Gauranga due to His golden complexion.  As stated in the scriptures, the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and taught the importance of devotion to Lord Krishna through congregational chanting of the holy names of God, known as the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra. He appeared on Phalguni Purnima, the full moon day in Phalguna (Feb-March) in 1486 AD (1407 Shakabda) at Sridham Mayapur as the son of Sri Jagannath Mishra and Srimati Sachidevi. His parents named Him Nimai since He was born under a Nimba (neem) tree in the courtyard of His paternal house. This festival also marks the beginning of the New Year for Gaudiya Vaishnavas.",
