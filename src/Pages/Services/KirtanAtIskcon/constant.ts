  "ISKCON, kirtan involves singing and chanting the names of God in a call-and-response style, with the leader singing a line and the congregation responding in unison.",

  "The practice of kirtan is rooted in ancient Vedic tradition and has been passed down through generations of saints, sages, and devotees. It is said that the chanting of God’s names has the power to purify the heart and mind, awaken the soul, and bring one closer to the divine.",

  "In ISKCON, kirtan is often accompanied by traditional Indian instruments such as the mridanga, harmonium, and kartals, which add depth and richness to the music. The melodies are often simple and easy to follow, making it easy for even those with no prior musical experience to participate.",

  "During kirtan, participants focus their attention on the names and qualities of God, allowing themselves to be fully absorbed in the devotional mood of the music. As the chanting builds in intensity, the atmosphere becomes charged with spiritual energy, and it is not uncommon for participants to experience feelings of deep joy, peace, and connection to the divine.",
