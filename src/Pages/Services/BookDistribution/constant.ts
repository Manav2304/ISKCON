  ' "Books are the foundation", as Srila Prabhupad always said. The significance of disseminating Srila Prabhupad’s transcendental literature cannot be overstated. On numerous occasions, it has been observed that Srila Prabhupad prioritised the publication and distribution of books over the construction of temples or any other societal activity. The mission of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was spread throughout the world thanks to Srila Prabhupad’s transcendental books. This was also the state of mind of his spiritual master, Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur Prabhupad, who wrote volumes upon volumes of transcendental literature. As a result, book distribution remains one of the most important services provided by devotees.',
