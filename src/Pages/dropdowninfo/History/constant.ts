  "International Society for Krishna Consciousness), also known as the Hare Krishna movement, is a worldwide spiritual organization that was founded in 1966 by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The movement is based on the teachings of the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad Bhagavatam, two ancient Hindu scriptures that describe the philosophy of Krishna consciousness.",
  "The roots of ISKCON can be traced back to the early 20th century, when a young boy named Abhay Charan De (later known as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada) was born in Calcutta, India. Abhay Charan De was deeply influenced by his spiritual teacher, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who urged him to spread the teachings of Lord Krishna to the Western world.",
  "In 1965, at the age of 70, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada set sail for New York City with only a few dollars in his pocket and a crate of books containing his translations and commentaries on the Bhagavad-gita. He arrived in America alone and without any contacts or resources, but he was determined to fulfill his spiritual master's wishes.",
  "After several months of struggle and hardship, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada established the first ISKCON temple in New York City in 1966. The movement quickly gained popularity among young people who were seeking an alternative to the materialistic culture of the 1960s.",
  "By the early 1970s, ISKCON had spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, Australia, and South America. The movement's emphasis on vegetarianism, meditation, and devotion to Lord Krishna resonated with people from all walks of life, and ISKCON grew into a global spiritual community.",
  "Over the years, ISKCON movement has made significant contributions to the fields of spirituality, vegetarianism, and sustainable living.",
  "Today, ISKCON has hundreds of temples, ashrams, and centers around the world, and its members continue to spread the teachings of Lord Krishna through various activities, including kirtans, festivals, and humanitarian projects. The movement remains a vibrant and important part of the global spiritual landscape, attracting seekers of all ages and backgrounds who are drawn to its message of love, compassion, and devotion.",
